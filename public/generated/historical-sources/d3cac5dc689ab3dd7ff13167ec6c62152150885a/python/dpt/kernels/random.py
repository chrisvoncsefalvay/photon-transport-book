"""Counter-addressed Philox4x32-10 shared by transport and observations.

The counter is (identity low, identity high, event, domain); the key is the
64-bit seed. All coordinates are explicit: scheduling and rejection in another
history cannot change this history's stream. Domain 0 belongs to transport.
Domains 1..0x7fffffff belong to observations; transport rejection streams use
domains >= 0x80000000. Counter
coordinates must never wrap; the host boundary rejects exhausted identities.

Constants and round schedule: Random123, Salmon et al. (SC11), Philox4x32-10,
https://github.com/DEShawResearch/random123/blob/main/include/Random123/philox.h.
This is the published algorithm expressed in Warp, not a bundled copy of a
third-party implementation. These functions return no persistent RNG state.
